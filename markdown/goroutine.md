# Goroutine Points

The main goroutine refers specifically to the goroutine that runs the main function, which is the entry point of the application not every funcion have goroutine just have one which created main funcion (the entry point of GO app). Let me clarify this in detail:

# What is the Main Goroutine?

1. ### Definition: 
   - The main goroutine is the first goroutine that is automatically created when a Go program starts.

   - It is responsible for executing the main function, which is the entry point of the application.

2. ### Behavior:
- When the main goroutine finishes executing (i.e., when the main function returns), the entire program exits, regardless of whether other goroutines are still running.


- This means that if you start other goroutines (e.g., to run an HTTP server), you must ensure the main goroutine does not exit prematurely, or else those goroutines will be terminated abruptly.

# Key Points About the Main Goroutine
1. ### Entry Point:
- The main function is the entry point of the program, and the goroutine that runs it is the main goroutine.
2. ### Program Lifetime:
- The lifetime of the entire program is tied to the main goroutine. If the main goroutine exits, the program exits, and all other goroutines are terminated immediately.
3. ### Blocking the Main Goroutine:
- To keep the program running (e.g., to allow an HTTP server to continue handling requests), you must block the main goroutine from exiting. This is typically done using synchronization mechanisms like channels, signal.Notify, or select{}.

# Goroutines and Function Scope

In Go, goroutines are independent of the function that starts them. When you launch a goroutine using go, it runs concurrently and independently of the function that spawned it. This means:
1. <b>The goroutine continues running<b> even after the function that started it returns.


2. <b>The goroutine only terminates if<b>:
   - It completes its task (e.g., e.Start returns).

   - The program exits (e.g., the main goroutine finishes).

   - It encounters a fatal error (e.g., e.Logger.Fatal).

# Summary
#### Question: ok you mean when i use go keyword in a function scope when that functions finishes or returned all goroutines which spawned in that function doesnt terminate after function returned or finished?

Exactly! When you use the go keyword to start a goroutine inside a function, the goroutine continues to run independently even after the function that spawned it finishes. The goroutine will only terminate under the following conditions:
1. The goroutine completes its task: If the goroutine finishes executing the code it was given, it will terminate naturally.


2. The program exits: If the main goroutine (or the program itself) exits, all other goroutines are terminated immediately, regardless of their state.


3. A fatal error occurs: If the goroutine encounters a fatal error (e.g., log.Fatal, panic, etc.), it will terminate.

# Key Points About Goroutines and Function Scope
1. ### Goroutines are independent:
   - When you use go to start a goroutine, it runs concurrently and independently of the function that created it.
   - The function that started the goroutine can return, but the goroutine will continue running.

2. ### Function scope does not affect goroutines:
   - The lifetime of a goroutine is not tied to the scope of the function that created it.

   - Even if the function that started the goroutine finishes execution, the goroutine will continue running as long as the program is still alive.

3. ### Goroutines and the main goroutine:
- If the main goroutine (the one running the main function) exits, the entire program terminates, and all other goroutines are stopped abruptly.
