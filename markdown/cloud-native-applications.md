# what is cloud native means?
It means high access to infinite resourses.
Imagine you have an application which user upload-download files if your hard goes fool
what do you do? but when you use a cloud service like AWS it has a s3 or minIO service for storing file and 
you dont need to worry about file storing infrastructure this service is high available means AWS itself make backup
of files.

### Independence:
Each part of cloudnative applications are independent to each other ,this means also you can
develop , deploy and maintain them individually.

### Resiliency:
A well-designed cloud native application is able to survive and stay online even in the event of an infrastructure outage.
 #### Key Principles for Surviving Infrastructure Outages
1. Microservices Architecture

Decomposing the app into loosely coupled services ensures that a failure in one component doesnâ€™t bring down the entire system.

Each service can be scaled, updated, and recovered independently.

2. Auto-Scaling & Self-Healing

Kubernetes (or managed services like EKS/GKE/AKS) can automatically restart failed containers or spin up new instances.

3. Chaos Engineering & Fault Tolerance Testing

Proactively testing failures (e.g., killing instances, network partitions) using tools like Chaos Monkey or Gremlin ensures the system can recover gracefully.

### No Downtime
Imagine if you want to run your database service you have one instance but when run it by cloud provider it consider
3 instance one master and 2 slaves when master goes down use one of slaves to prevent downtime.
